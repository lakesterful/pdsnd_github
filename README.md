# Bikeshare

## Description
The Bikeshare Project is the second part in Udacity's Nanodegree "Programming for Data Science with Python". Here, data provided by Motivate is used to analyze datasets from a bikeshare company in the following three cities: Chicago, Washington, and New York City.

Following datasets were provided:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

* Gender
* Birth Year

The following statistics were computed:

1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

2 Popular stations and trip

* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3 Trip duration

* total travel time
* average travel time

4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

### Files used
* bikeshare.py (template with helper code)
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
Thanks for Udacity for providing helpful information and guidance in order to learn Python.
